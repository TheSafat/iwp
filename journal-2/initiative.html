        <h2>MDPI Initiatives</h2>
        <p>In everything that we do, our mission is to foster open science and scientific exchange. Over the years, MDPI has developed a set of initiatives designed to help scientists achieve their own objectives. On this page, you will find information on these initiatives and how each supports our core activity, journal publishing.</p>

        <h2>Sciforum</h2>
        <p>Sciforum is an event-planning platform that allows scholars not only to participate in academic conferences but to organize their own events also. Sciforum reduces the administrative efforts of organizers by allowing them to easily set up and manage their conference website, as well as handle the peer-review process, conference registration and billing, etc. Moreover, organizers can select from a range of paid services what aspects of the organization process they would like to delegate to our Sciforum staff.
        </p>

        <h2>Books</h2>
        <p>MDPI Books offers academic authors the possibility to publish their work in various book forms. Whether it is a short-form or full-length monograph, a chapter in an edited volume or a full textbook, we are dedicated to providing you with personal and individual support. MDPI Books also provides reprint services, such as Special Issue Reprints or Selections of articles of your choice.
        </p>

        <h2>Encyclopedia</h2>
        <p>As a user-generated content platform for researchers, Encyclopedia aims to supply a clear scholarly reference on scientific topics and concepts, as well as provide benchmark information for researchers in every field. Our mission is to record and spread knowledge without any restrictions, to help researchers find what they need quickly and accurately, and our scope contains all aspects of natural sciences and social sciences. Based on the development of the Encyclopedia platform, we also set up a peer-reviewed namesake journal and a series of Encyclopedia books.
